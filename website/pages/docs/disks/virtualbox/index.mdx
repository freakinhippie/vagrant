# VirtualBox

~> **Warning!** This feature is experimental and may break or
change in between releases. Use at your own risk. It currently is not officially
supported or functional.

This feature currently reqiures the experimental flag to be used. To explicitly enable this feature, you can set the experimental flag to:

```
VAGRANT_EXPERIMENTAL="disks"
```

Please note that `VAGRANT_EXPERIMENTAL` is an environment variable. For more
information about this flag visit the [Experimental docs page](/docs/experimental/)
for more info. Without this flag enabled, any disks defined will not be configured.

**Vagrant currently only supports VirtualBox version 5.x and newer for configuring and
attaching disks.**

Because of how VirtualBox handles disk management, a Vagrant guest _must_ be powered
off for any changes to be applied to a guest. If you make a configuration change
with a guests disk, you will need to `vagrant reload` the guest for any changes
to be applied.

When new disks are defined to be attached to a guest, Vagrant will create and attach
these disks to a guests SATA Controller. It should be noted that up to 30 disks
can be attached to the SATA Controller.

For more information on how to use VirtualBox to configure disks for a guest, refer
to the [general usage](/docs/disks/usage) and [configuration](/docs/disks/configuration)
guide for more information.
